        <u>Linear System of Equations</u> - is made up of two equations with two variables. A solution for a linear system
        is a set of one value for each variable that solves both equations at the same time. If the variables are x and y,
        the solution is an ordered pair which represents a point where two equations' lines intersect on a coordinate plane.<br />
        <u>The Elimination Method</u> - Depends on the fact that if two equations are true both the left and right sides of each
        equation can be added to create a new equation.<br />
        If a = b and c = d then a + c = b + d, or can multiply by same value, if a = b then ma = mb<br />
        <u>The Substitution Method</u> - An equation needs to have one of the variables expressed in terms of the other,
        or we will need to solve for one of the variables. Once we have a variable equal to an expression, we can substitute
        that equation for that variable in the other equation.<br />
